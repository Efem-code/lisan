# Put Lisan on the phone over USB.
#
# Two tricks are doing the work here.
#
# 1. `adb reverse` makes the Mac's server reachable from the phone on
#    localhost. Browsers treat loopback as a secure origin even over plain
#    http, which is what lets the service worker register and the "Install
#    app" option appear. A LAN address like http://192.168.1.20 is not a
#    secure origin, so there would be no offline mode and no install.
#
# 2. The URL is http://lisan.localhost:8779, not http://localhost:8779.
#    Chromium resolves any *.localhost name to loopback and still treats it as
#    secure, and this matters more than it looks: an installed web app claims
#    its whole host on Android, with no regard for the port. Anvil, installed
#    from plain localhost, registered itself for http://localhost on *every*
#    port — so opening any other localhost app produced an "Open with Anvil?"
#    chooser instead of the app you wanted. Giving each app its own hostname
#    keeps them from fighting over the loopback address.
#
# Once installed, the app caches itself and runs with the cable unplugged and
# the phone in aeroplane mode. Re-run this only to push an update.

  On the phone: the app shows an **Install** button along the bottom.
  Tap it. If it does not appear, use the browser's own menu (⋮):
    Add to Home screen   (Brave)
    Install app          (Chrome)

  Once installed, later runs of this script update it automatically — open
  the app while this is running and it reloads itself on the new build.

  $APP then has its own icon, launches without a browser bar, and works with
  no signal at all. You can unplug once it has loaded once.

  Leave this running while you install. Ctrl-C when done.
